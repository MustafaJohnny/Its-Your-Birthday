# It's Your Birthday! - React Practical Project

## Overview

It's Your Birthday is a simple and great React Application. This App will allow users to exactly know, how much days and hours is left until their next birthday. The user simply inputs his birthday date and then the timer will start. This project was a little challenging for me but I really had so much fun building it, maybe the app seems easy from the outside but from the inside I just wanted to go wild and use everything I know so far about React in it. I'm truly proud of this one!
